I also, obviously like that it is a lift the flap book, because they engage my son for so long. One of the reasons I chose this particular book is because it addresses body parts and I thought it would be helpful when learning those body parts.What I don't like:Quality, quality, quality! We own several board books, but this one isn't nearly as nice as many others we own and have seen. He is 19 moths at the time of writing this and we have had it for about 6 months now and it has not held up nearly as well as the other lift the flap books we own, and he plays with this one far less. He loves his books and isn't very rough with them, so this is one of the few books we have that are damaged. The pages are very thin compared to literally every other board book we own, and the flaps are extremely flimsy and got bent during the first use.Overall, we like this book, but if I could go back in time I would choose a different book. It has not been a hit for us and is a bit disappointing. I would have given it 4 stars (maybe 5) if the quality was better.","rating":3,"author":"Ashley","date":"2015-12-02T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R3UMDZ3JH2JJF8","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UMDZ3JH2JJF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","title":"Her favorite book","text":"Baby's favorite book and she's pulled out almost all the pages lol.

Although it isn't very long, it is just the right length for babies and younger children. Colorful images and the fun lift-the-flap pages had our baby (and even her 4 year old big sister) giggling along in no time. The book is just the right size to hold in your hands while holding your little one. The only draw back is making sure the flaps don't get torn. My baby was immediately tugging and pulling on the flaps and with the right amount of force, it would tear right off. Even with that concern though, I still would recommend this book!","rating":5,"author":"pmdonnelly","date":"2015-12-25T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R3QKCZV42H5JEI","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QKCZV42H5JEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","title":"A must buy!","text":"I got this book for my then 5 month old infant and he was fascinated with the concept of things concealed. This was the first book he actually loved and engaged with. We read through this book with him daily. He quickly grasped the concept of \"Where is ...\" and was excited when the flaps where lifted to reveal the item. I noticed that he also quickly translated it to things in his surroundings. When asked where is Dada etc, he would look in the direction of the person or item long before \"they\", meaning the experts, said he should. He is now 13 months old and still loves the book. Ever since he could walk and multitask, it surprised us that he would take this book up and walk to either his Dad or me so we could read it to him. Needless to say, it's pretty worn at this stage. If there is a less than positive remark I can make is that, although it's a board book, my little guy found a way to rip most of the flaps off. There is tape on every page :-) Not so sure if they could make it any sturdier though. Love this book!!! Definitely get it for your little one.","rating":5,"author":"kytuh utytgyuh","date":"2014-01-19T22:00:00.000Z"}]}

The color choices on each page is like a work of art. Of all the books this has been the most beautiful to look at, and both I and my son have enjoyed this book for two months now. So why four stars? The flaps are very, very thin. For this kind of a book the construction is of very poor quality and of all the lift-the-flap books my son has, this has been the most poorly made and deserves only one star. However, because I like the images of this book I still give it four stars. But one of the flaps is long gone. I purchased this together with \"Dear Zoo\" and in comparison between the two books is like night and day. \"Dear Zoo\" has held up very nicely (also much beloved by my son) because the flaps are made of carton-like paper. But \"Where Is Baby's Belly Button\" uses thin paper for the flaps. I hope the publishers correct this design flaw. If yes, then I'll very happily purchase it again for future baby #2 :)","rating":4,"author":"S.S.","date":"2014-09-15T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R3U0AGCN0XLFYW","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U0AGCN0XLFYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","title":"Four Stars","text":"Not good for little kids.

Big mistake. Sorry, but I just don't get why it's so popular. My daughter likes it OK - I like it less.

He seemed to like it -- well, he would at least sit still on my lap long enough to turn the pages and lift the flaps!  Three months later, it is definitely his favorite book -- he giggles when I pull it out, and loves to lift the flaps up and down, and up and down, and up and down.  After three months of all that upping and downing the flaps ARE raggedy and curled up, but he doesn't seem to mind. I figure on buying it again when it really gets worn.

My daughter likes turning the flaps & finding the hidden body part, then she'll point to that body part on herself. It is a cute, informative book, but I do get scared that the paper flaps will tear when they're being pulled by a toddler.","rating":4,"author":"Christina Rydzewski","date":"2015-08-09T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R34R8UQM5K3CA8","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34R8UQM5K3CA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","title":"Very engaging for my 15-month old granddaughter.

I gave lots of these books to my nephew's kids as gifts.  My nephew's wife is VERY picky as to what she likes - I think she wasn't sure what she thought of these books at first, but her son chooses these books to be read time and time again.  I think she likes the sturdiness of the board books.  I loved lift-the-flap when I was a kid - I'm glad my grand(?)-nephew enjoys them too - they make reading books (and learning from them) fun!","rating":5,"author":"BengalBasket","date":"2013-12-27T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2AF2W42NTLN03","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AF2W42NTLN03/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","title":"Adorable lift the flap book that holds up well!","text":"My now 3.5 year old daughter loved Karen Katz books when she was younger.

Loves the flaps. But older versions of these books has flaws: the flaps are glued to the main page by a tiny thin side. Rips of easily.
